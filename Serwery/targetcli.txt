 First of all, it is possible to use it in Jessie, I am using it right now. Now, for the other issues:

    It was removed from Jessie due to a bug which caused some upgrade issues from the previous versions (https://tracker.debian.org/news/671121)

    You don't have to use 'targetcli', you can pretty much do everything from sysfs. However, it is obviously easier to manage using targetcli.

    Finally, the official version is from Datera (https://github.com/Datera/targetcli). However, it is recommended to use the forked versions: https://github.com/agrover/targetcli-fb, https://github.com/agrover/rtslib-fb, https://github.com/agrover/configshell-fb

Hope this helps.

Thanks, I'll try that out tonight.

Edit: I got it to work. To be honest I much preferred the configuration file of IET to the weird targetcli shell, but after some fiddling, I got it to work with a Windows initiator. I may write up my experience into a short tutorial/article.

For anyone curious, I did end up getting this installed on my Jessie server. I use it to serve out ZFS zvol's across my LAN.

It was a lot easier than I expected, the hardest part being the somewhat confusing targetcli tool:

    I cloned the three repos mentioned by /u/dotnix,

    Ran inside of each project folder:

    sudo ./setup.py build && sudo ./setup.py install

    Then I just partially followed this guide for setting up the targets.
